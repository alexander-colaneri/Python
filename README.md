'''Everything related to Python'''
 
This is a repository to show my Python codes to everyone who wants to know about my trajectory related to Python.

Python is my debut in programming language universe. So expect to find from my first "Hello, World!" code to the latest ones until now.

For now, you'll find my **studies** directory, which has two different directories included.

- **curso_em_video** is a directory with the exercises I've been completing on "Curso em Video" course (www.cursoemvideo.com). This is a course created by Gustavo Guanabara, a very known teacher in programming language in Brazil. It's where I began my studies.
- **jetbrains)academy** is a directory with projects and exercises from JetBrains Academy, where I put my skills to the test in more complex projects.

From time to time, I update my exercises with new skills I have learned, to bring a new standard to the quality of the work that is shown here.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub! Feel free to ask me any questions you may have. Have a nice day!
